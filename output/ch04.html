The elicitation phase is based on a goal-based approach. Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering (GORE) is considered an established
paradigm in requirements engineering to handle elicitation, specification, analysis, negotiation and evolution of
requirements by using goals [1]. GORE approaches, such as KAOS [2] were developed to support the development of large-scale systems by
providing different models, where the goal model is naturally the central one. Eliciting requirements for such
large-scale models is typically performed in a stepwise manner.
The higher-level goals are decomposed into less abstract goals. The results of requirements elicitation must then be mapped
into analysis models. In this tutorial, the modeling phase uses <a class="ulink" href="http://www.omgwiki.org/OMGSysML/" target="_top">SysML</a> [3],
an <a class="ulink" href="http://www.omg.org" target="_top">OMG</a> modeling language for systems getting more and more popularity
(used in Airbus, Thales, Continental among others), being taught in several countries
and that start to be a pivot language for many others (e.g., Modelica, Simulink).</p><p>The focus will be on the integration of high level requirements models with SysML models, and their traceability [5]. A practical case study using models animation will be practiced by attendees [4].
Indeed if no attention is paid to how requirements relate with each other in different requirements phases,
there is a danger that the nature of these relationships will only become clear during later stages of software development when problems are more costly to rectify.
