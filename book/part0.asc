== Abstract

This tutorial aims at presenting an integrated approach for systems requirements elicitation and modeling.
The elicitation phase is based on a goal-based approach. Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering (GORE) is considered an established 
paradigm in requirements engineering to handle elicitation, specification, analysis, negotiation and evolution of 
requirements by using goals [1]. GORE approaches, such as KAOS [2] were developed to support the development of large-scale systems by 
providing different models, where the goal model is naturally the central one. Eliciting requirements for such 
large-scale models is typically performed in a stepwise manner. 
The higher-level goals are decomposed into less abstract goals. The results of requirements elicitation must then be mapped
into analysis models. In this tutorial, the modeling phase uses {SysML} [3], 
an {OMG} modeling language for systems getting more and more popularity
(used in Airbus, Thales, Continental among others), being taught in several countries
and that start to be a pivot language for many others (e.g., Modelica, Simulink). 

The focus will be on the integration of high level requirements models with SysML models, and their traceability [5]. A practical case study using models animation will be practiced by attendees [4].
Indeed if no attention is paid to how requirements relate with each other in different requirements phases, 
there is a danger that the nature of these relationships will only become clear during later stages of software development when problems are more costly to rectify. 

== Aims and Learning Objectives

Learn the basics of systems modeling using {SysML}. But before modeling with SysML we need to specify higher level requirements models, where goals of the application are determined before building the system's models. Here the participants will learn how to elaborate the requirements using the goal-based approach KAOS.
Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering (GORE) has received increasing attention over the past few years. There are several goal-oriented approaches, each one using different kinds of models. Here we will use the KAOS approach [5].
KAOS is a systematic approach for discovering and structuring system level requirements. In KAOS, goals can be divided into requirements (a type of goal to be achieved by a software agent), expectations (a type of goal to be achieved by an environment agent) and soft goals (e.g., quality attributes). In KAOS, goals can be refined into subgoals through and/or decompositions. There is also the possibility of specifying conflicts between goals. KAOS also introduces the concept of obstacle that is a situation that prevents the achievement of a goal. Usually the solution to the obstacle is expressed in the form of a new requirement.
KAOS will be the basis for the {SysML} requirements specification.
